# U.Py.Home
A group of python users and enthusiasts to improve upon their python skill-sets as a community. This will involve UWM students, post-docs, faculty-members (both current and past).  We call it U.Py because it is made for UWM personnel and also as it sounds like You.Py, inspiring people to code in python.
